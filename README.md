## About The Project

Tetra is a Discord bot project that greatly simplifies importing emotes from various services such as 7TV, BTTV, FFZ or direct links to sources onto your Discord server.

The built-in automatic file optimization feature requires no additional action from users, and the optional scaling function allows you to adjust the emote to look its best.

Additionally Tetra offers a few other smaller but equally exciting features, such as adding unavailable emotes directly from messages or reactions.
